Dear Friends,

We need you!

We are in the midst of an epic battle of good versus evil.
If good is to win - then truth must win.

Please join us as we unite to defend Israel, the United States and the free world in the critical battle for hearts and minds.

The brave people of Israel stand on the front lines eager to fight for their survival - and ours.

Meanwhile our enemies appear to be winning the propaganda war by ignoring facts and promoting false narratives. For decades they have incited the hatred and violence which led to the horrific massacre on October 7. They are now on the streets en masses portraying Israel and Jews as subhuman oppressors who got what was coming to them.

THIS MUST BE EFFECTIVELY COUNTERED NOW!

"1. The Dead Sea Scrolls: Discovered in the mid-20th century in the caves of Qumran near the Dead Sea, these scrolls include Jewish texts dating back to the Second Temple period (around 516 BCE to 70 CE). These texts provide valuable insight into Jewish religious practices and beliefs during that time.

2. Jericho: Located in Judea&Samaria, Jericho is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world. It has yielded archaeological evidence of various Jewish settlements and historical events mentioned in the Hebrew Bible.

3. Shiloh: Mentioned in the Hebrew Bible as the first place where the Israelites settled after entering the Promised Land, excavations at Shiloh have revealed the remains of Jewish structures, including a large building that many believe to be the ancient Tabernacle.

4. Mount Gerizim: Located near the city of Nablus in the West Bank, Mount Gerizim is considered sacred to the Samaritans, a small religious community who follow closely to the beliefs of ancient Israel. Archaeological surveys of the mountain have revealed Jewish artifacts and structures, indicating Jewish presence in the area.

5. Sebastia: This ancient city located in the northern West Bank is historically identified as the biblical city of Samaria, the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Israel. Numerous excavations have revealed Jewish architectural remains, including a massive palace complex believed to have belonged to King Herod.

6. Herodium: Situated southeast of Jerusalem, Herodium was a fortress and palace built by King Herod the Great. Excavations at the site have uncovered parts of a Jewish palace, a bathhouse, elaborate frescoes, and a synagogue, indicating Jewish presence at the time.

7. Shomron: The Shomron National Park covers the area of ancient Samaria, which was once inhabited by Israelites and later by Samaritans during the Second Temple period. Recent excavations have uncovered Jewish synagogues, ritual baths, and inscriptions with Hebrew inscriptions.

These are just a few examples of Jewish archaeological findings in Judea and Samaria. There are numerous other sites in the region that provide valuable insights into Jewish history and civilization.

"Something more about the Palestinians and the ""Land of the Fathers""

Around the year 1700, a young Dutchman named Adrian Reland (in English spelling - Adrian Reland - 1718-1676) worked in the land, then called Palestine. He was probably a serious genius who mastered at least five languages: Dutch, Latin, ancient Greek, Arabic and Hebrew, and was a geographer, cartographer (mapping expert), linguist and above all an adventurer. He traveled around Israel for probably quite a few months, documenting about 2,500 biblical and current sites of his time, including demographic documentation.
This journey was later summarized in a book of about 1,200 pages in two volumes, published several years later.

The name of the book is Palaestina Ex Monumentis Veteribus Illustrata and it is written mainly in Latin, with many passages in Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and more.
This book is available in its entirety online and can be downloaded for example at
https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/pdf/b30535062
Unfortunately, I rarely read Latin, but there are those who do and have bothered to read. I checked several sources about the book, and even consulted ChatGPT about it. Here is one of the sources:
https://www.solonin.org/en/article_palestinian-issue
I will not expand the review but will only deal with the demographic dimension.
Reland's basic conclusion at that time was that the country is more or less empty, and most of its inhabitants are Jews, most of the rest are Christians, and the rest are other minorities, including Muslims. The Jews are not only ""Orthodox"" who came to pray or die in Israel, they are engaged in agriculture and make a living from it.

He describes a situation in which the big cities number at most a few thousand people. According to him, there are about 5,000 residents in Jerusalem, of which about two-thirds are Jews, about one-third are Christians, and the Muslims are a negligible minority. There are 550 people in Gaza, half of them Jews and half of them Christians (today there are 1.2 million people in Gaza and the refugee camps around it; most of them are Muslims). Nazareth is populated by Christians only (about 700). In Tiberias and Safed Jews only. In Umm-el-Fahm, 10 families, all Maronite Christians. Similarly, the other main cities Acre, Jaffa, Hebron are populated mainly by Jews and Christians. The only ""city"" that has a Muslim majority is Nablus, where there are 120 Muslims and another 70 Samaritans (today Nablus has over 150,000 people, most of whom are Muslim; the number of Samaritans in Israel today is about 700). Apart from these, the majority of the country's Muslim residents are Bedouins who migrate from place to place and are sometimes employed as temporary laborers in the cities - not people who have any property.

Now let's understand the context - the year 1700 is about 180 years before the critical year for the Jews - 1882, in which a significant immigration to Israel for Zionist reasons begins for the first time. In those years, mainly due to high infant mortality, the rate of population growth in the Middle East was extremely slow. You can look at the numbers between 1700 and 1882 which are similar in pace and even slower, but it is more convenient to look at the numbers up to the First World War, after which the British were here whose numbers are a little more reliable. So from 1700 to 1912, the population of Egypt grew from 4.5 to 11.6 million, Iraq from 1 to 2.9 million, Iran from 5 to 10.7, Syria from 1.25 to 2.0, Sudan from 4.5 to 5.3.
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population?tab=table&time=1700..1912

At the end of the First World War, there were about 600,000 Muslim Arabs in the Western Land of Israel. Even if it is calculated according to the maximum growth rate (Iraq), in 1700 there should have been about 200 thousand Muslims in the country. According to Reland's testimony, there is no way that was the number. They were simply not here, certainly not as permanent residents with clear possessions. Let's be clear, a person who wanders in an empty desert without having any property in his possession or being in it regularly, cannot later claim a certain house as his home for generations.

The conclusion from all this discussion is simple - the Palestinian argument as if the Palestinian people have lived in the land for thousands of years or ""for generations"" - is completely unfounded. In 1700 the country was almost empty of Muslims. They arrived here in significant numbers as migrant workers in the 19th century, with the encouragement of the Turkish rulers, and even larger numbers arrived after the Jews began immigrating to Israel in 1882, to work in agriculture, which the Jews began to develop here. This trend continued until the First World War and throughout the days of the Mandate. When a person whose last name is Baghdadi or Halabi claims to be Palestinian, what he is actually saying is that his family arrived in Israel, from Iraq or Syria, as migrant workers 80 to 200 years ago. I'm not saying that he can't be considered a Palestinian today, but to claim that this is the property of his ancestors for generations is simply ridiculous.

Supranational Federation for Israel and Palestine

Yehuda A Schwartz
Describe a supranational federation for Israel and Palestine, guaranteeing strong autonomy for both people without territorial partition

A supranational federation for Israel and Palestine would be a political entity that combines the sovereignty of both states into a single entity, while still maintaining strong autonomy for both peoples. This federation would be governed by a central government that is responsible for certain common functions, such as foreign relations and security, but would also allow for regional governments to have a significant degree of control over their own affairs.

Under this federation, both Israel and Palestine would be able to maintain their own distinct cultural and religious identities, and would be able to make decisions that reflect their unique needs and values. Each region would be able to pass laws and regulations that are specific to their own population, as long as they do not violate the overall principles of the federation.

The supranational federation would also guarantee strong autonomy for both Israel and Palestine, allowing them to have control over their own economies, education systems, and other domestic policies. This would allow each region to pursue its own development goals, while still being part of a larger, unified entity.

Overall, a supranational federation for Israel and Palestine would be a way to bring these two peoples together and create a more peaceful and prosperous future for all. It would allow both sides to maintain their own identities and traditions, while also working together to address common challenges and achieve shared goals.

“We have four plots in Yaniel and a Galilee country home in Migdal,” he says. “With the tensions in the north, they’re on hold right now.” Several towns in northern Israel have been evacuated due to continual rocket and missile fire from Lebanon towards Israel, including an incident in which an IDF soldier was killed.

“The war has significantly impacted everyone’s plans for buying any private residential land right now.” In Israel, Busner explains, only seven percent of all land is owned by private individuals, with the rest owned by the government or the Jewish National Fund and developed under extremely long-term leases. “There’s enough danger to keep people from making new plans or closing deals.”

"The Old City of Jerusalem l / from a Jewish view
Significance For Jews

Jewish literature details that when the Messiah (the promised deliverer of the Jewish nation as prophesied in the Jewish bible) arrives, he will enter Jerusalem through the Eastern Gate. Talmudic literature also refers to this gate as the Shushan Gate, due to its Eastern direction toward the Persian city (now modern-day Iran). There is debate as to whether the name is meant to pay homage to the Persian leader Cyrus, who allowed Jews to return to Jerusalem in the 6th century B.C.E. to rebuild the Temple. Additionally, the gate is significant for Jews because according to tradition, on the holiday of Yom Kippor (Day of Atonement), a Temple messenger was sent through this gate with a sacrificial lamb to the desert. Therefore, the gate holds historical and traditional significance for the Jews, as well as remaining an indicator of the Messiah who is meant to come.

The sealed Golden Gate
Why Was the Gate Sealed?
As mentioned previously, the Eastern gate was ultimately sealed shut in 1541 by the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman. However, prior to this time, the gate was closed in 810 (also by the Muslims), then reopened in 1102 by the Crusaders, and then walled up again by Saladin (the first sultan of Egypt and Syria and the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty) after defeating the Crusaders in 1187 and gaining control of Palestine and the city of Jerusalem.

The final sealing shut of the gate as completed by Suleiman is said to have been a defensive move by the sultan. As derived from the Jewish literature, the gate is said to be the point at which the Jewish Messiah will enter the city of Jerusalem, and therefore, in order to prevent this from occurring, the sultan sealed the gate.",against

Israeli soldier carries his fallen comrade who fell in battle defending the State of Israel. In all of Israel's wars, the Jewish nation has never asked friends and supporters around the world to send soldiers to bleed & die for Israel. Since Israel's independence in 1948, the Children of Israel have stood alone in the face of insurmountable odds, alone in numerous battles, the Nation of Israel have faced their enemies in the fight for survival and defeated them in every major war. But a dangerous new war has been exploding and the supporters of Israel across the World have little clue of its impact on Israel.

🔴IDENTIFYING THIS DANGEROUS NEW WAR

Do you live in a country with a majority Christian population and yet your government has not recognized Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel? Think about it. Does your government continually vote against Israel inside the U.N. ? If your answer is yes than you need to read this post to its very end.

This dangerous new war requires the help of every single supporter of Israel in the World. This war is waged in the #information_Arena where the enemies of Israel outnumber the armies of Israel many times over.

🔵POWER ORGANIZATIONS AGAINST ISRAEL

The United Nations is a major power against Israel. Human Rights organizations are against Israel too. Many international forums have been manipulated by the enemies of Israel.

The enemies of Israel have bombarded the World with misinformation calculated to harm Israel's foundation by fraudulently rewriting its ancient past. This war denies Israel's current existence and threatens Israel's very destiny.

🔴PINPOINTING ISRAEL'S ENEMIES

The Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) made up of 57 Muslim nations, runs the agenda against Israel & many non-Muslim countries have been trapped to vote with the OIC inside the UN.

✝️🛡THEY ARE REWRITING BIBLE HISTORY AND THE CHRISTIAN WORLD HAS BEEN MADE NUMB TO THIS

The Muslim nations are rewriting the Holy Bible's history inside the UN by denying Jewish connection to the holy city of Jerusalem. They continually sponsor UN resolutions that give political weight to their lies. The UN entrenches those malicious lies into various international laws (resolutions) that exist today.

Some of these laws cannot be enforced, however, they still hold a lot of political weight that is very destructive to the survival of Israel.

Any attack on Jewish connection to Jerusalem is an attack on the Christian faith as well because Jesus was a Jew who was born in Bethlehem of Judea (Judea means homeland of Jews) & he taught in the Jewish temple in Jerusalem.

🔵💀☣THE UN IS MAKING LAWS THAT CUTS OFF BIBLE HISTORY COMPLETELY.

Misinformation used inside the UN in many official meetings over the decades. Latest example in mid November 2018 when the UN passed 21 resolutions condemning Israel compared to only 6 resolutions condemning the rest of the world combined in the same period.

Two weeks later in November 29, 2018, 6 resolutions were passed condemning Israel in that single day alone. One of those UN resolutions denied Jewish connection to the holy city Jerusalem which is famous today because of David & the Jews including Jesus.

🔴THE TRUTH

King David was a Jew from the tribe of Judah & he was not an Arab nor a Palestinian.

Another resolution in November 29, 2018 denied Jewish connection to the Temple Mount (with Wailing Wall) the site of King Solomon's temple in Jerusalem where Jesus had taught. This has been going on inside the UN every year now.

✝️☦THE UN IS CUTTING OFF CHRISTIAN HISTORY AS WELL BY CUTTING OFF JEWISH CONNECTION TO JERUSALEM

Christian doctrine states that Jesus is the King of the Jews as recorded in the Gospels of the Apostles in the New Testament. Fundamental Christian doctrine states that Jesus is a direct descendant of King David & his lineage in the Royal Davidic Bloodline of Jewish Kings who ruled ancient Israel and the ancient Jewish Kingdom of Judah.

🔵Jesus was a Jew whose ministry centered in the Land of Israel with the goal of touching the entire world, in Jesus' own words, ""BEGINNING IN JERUSALEM (see the UN hypocrisy of cutting off Jews from Jerusalem?) AND ONTO JUDEA & SAMARIA (Samaria has been renamed West Bank by the Muslims) AND TO THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE WORLD.""

🔴Jesus himself called Jerusalem ""The City of the Great King""...... (Palestine is not mentioned in the Christian Bible because it never existed during the time of Yeshua/Jesus as the Romans had not renamed Judea into Palestine after Israel's ancient enemy the Philistines who had disappeared from history by the time Yeshua/Jesus walked the earth).

💠EVIDENCE OF U.N. ANTI-ISRAEL POSITION & MANIPULATION BY MUSLIM COUNTRIES

The UN contains many intergovernmental bodies & they too have been poisoned by the anti-Israel agenda & a great example is the G-77 which is the biggest voting group of 135 countries inside the UN.

💠📛Egypt (Muslim nation) held the chairmanship of the G-77 in 2018 but gave it to Palestine (Another Muslim entity) to run the G-77 in 2019. Palestine is not even a state (Palestine is not a sovereign country with sovereign borders) by the UN's own definition & should never have been allowed to head the G-77 but the voting powers of the 57 Muslim nations & other dictator states inside the UN have endorsed Palestine to chair every session of the G-77 in 2019 & to speak as the single voice of the G-77 representing its 135 member countries inside the UN chambers for the duration of Palestine's chairmanship.

🔶️️The Muslim nations elevated Palestine inside the G-77 to counter President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital & moving the American embassy there.

☣WHAT DO MUSLIMS WANT

Muslim nations desire to make Jerusalem into the Islamic capital of a Muslim Caliphate (Muslim State) called Palestine. That desire is written in the Covenant of Hamas (Charter of Hamas) & highlighted in the secret dossier of the Muslim Brotherhood which was discovered a few decades ago.

💠🔷️Many countries around the world would love to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital but their governments are afraid of the Muslim countries threatening the use of their combined voting power & influence of 57 Muslim nations inside the intergovernmental bodies in the UN to impose punishment on nations (Nations with majority Christian populations as well) that recognize Jerusalem as the true capital of Israel.

🔶️☣💀HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS ARE SILENT AS THEY ARE AGAINST ISRAEL

Last week Hamas & Palestinian Islamic Jihad launched 690 rockets in less than 48 hours towards Israel. In direct violation of UN laws, but the UN Human Rights Council made no comment. To this day, the terrorist group Hamas has never been condemned by name not even once inside the UN & all its branches. Even after 32 years since the inception of Hamas & their terrorist network killing thousands of innocent Israelis (majority of the victims innocent Jews). While Israel has been condemned over 700 times inside the UN and its agencies.

Former U.S. ambassador to the UN @Nikki Haley condemned the U.N. for its bias against Israel especially the 700 condemnations on Israel compared to zero condemnation specifically by name on the terrorist group Hamas.

🔴*When you combine all the condemnation on the rest of the World, it still does not surpass the condemnation targeting Israel alone.

🔷️Undeniable evidence of the malicious poison against Israel inside this world body that is supposed to have a mandate for the good of *ALL HUMANITY*.

☠☣💀☢THE U.N. IS REPEATING HITLER'S STRATEGY

The U.N. is repeating the same tactic that Hitler did by first condemning the Jews during his rise to power and blaming all of Germany's economic & social problems on the Jewish people and in the end Hitler's condemnation of Jews led to the Nazis murdering 6 million innocent Jewish souls, young & old men, women and children from 1941 to 1945. The Holocaust began just like the U.N. is doing by first condemning the Jewish People of all the crimes in the World.

🛡YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO JOIN THE ISRAELI ARMY BUT YOU CAN HELP FIGHT FOR ISRAEL IN THIS WAR⚔🛡🕎

The lies and bias inside the UN can only be defeated through the supporters of Israel sharing information to friends and families about Israel's good image on social media - Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Tweeter, Pinterest etc and writing to your daily newspapers & local magazines and religious media platforms to spread the truth about Jewish history in Jerusalem from the Biblical perspective, historical and archaeological evidence and the pro-life standard of the Israel Defense Forces and the State of Israel in all its good image in the Holy Land.

🕎HOW CAN YOU HELP ISRAEL✡

Since the UN & other human rights organizations have been politically poisoned against Israel, then it is up to every single supporter of Israel all over the World to share Israel's ancient history & all the positive information about modern Israel on mass media (formal & informal media/social media) to inspire more support for the Nation of Israel.

TALK TO YOUR LEADERS ESPECIALLY THE POLITICIANS IN YOUR COMMUNITIES

Talk to your leaders especially the politicians & lawmakers (members of Parliament) to remember to stand with Israel inside the vipers nest the U.N.) and plead with your nations lawmakers to recognize Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel.

FIND ONE IF THERE IS NONE

If there are no pro-Israel politicians, find a good character that loves Israel deeply and has what it takes to be a great politician and plead with them to form a pro-Israel political party in your nation that has a good mandate for your nation and also to support Israel & the city of God, Jerusalem.

Share this to reach communities around the world who love and support the eternal nation of Israel 🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱 🇮🇱🇮🇱

May God bless you for standing with the Children of Israel 🙏🇮🇱🙏

In the aftermath of Kristallnacht, also called the “The Night if Broken Glass,” some 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and sent to Nazi concentration camps.
German Jews had been subjected to repressive policies since 1933, when Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) became chancellor of Germany. However, prior to Kristallnacht, these Nazi policies had been primarily nonviolent. After Kristallnacht, conditions for German Jews grew increasingly worse. During World War II (1939-45), Hitler and the Nazis implemented their so-called “Final Solution” to the what they referred to as the “Jewish problem,” and carried out the systematic murder of some 6 million European Jews in what came to be known as the Holocaust. #fbisrael",against

The IDF said ""we are fighting ghosts""
Israeli soldiers are screaming in pain as they invade Gaza.
Israeli soldiers reportedly to have said that they were fighting ghosts and backed off. Many even started mutiny.
The Times Of Israel quotes 'Like fighting ghosts': The challenge the IDF faces in destroying Hamas's tunnels.

Israeli soldiers testified to the fact that it was as if something supernatural was supporting the Palestinian people. And they don't understand where that powerful force comes from. They don't understand why they can't penetrate Gaza. Most of their tanks and most of their guns stopped working. Their soldiers were getting beaten, dragged and thrown around by some special powerful forces that they couldn't understand.

""When the Israeli army was on the Gaza border, suddenly half of the soldiers' legs stopped working. Their legs were deformed and they were lying on the ground and just screaming because they were afraid. And the remaining soldiers were trying to help them. And the Palestinian army destroyed 30 or more than their tanks and armored vehicles. The spokesperson for the Israeli army said that we are fighting ghosts... Subhanallah, are it actually Allah's soldiers or angels that Allah is using to fight them? That they feel like they are fighting ghosts. And one more thing, there are some Israeli soldiers said that when the Mujahideen (Palestinian soldiers) approached them and they were about to engage in battle, they (Israeli soldiers) felt like there was a great presence, like a big fear that something great was coming, like feeling a very strong force was coming and fought them. And apparently a Mujahid had just appeared who came and fought them, but they (the Israeli army) were already overwhelmed (because it seemed like there was a big force helping the Mujahid)""

"¥ What Is Shabbat?
• Shabbat is one of the most important Jewish observances and is the 4th of the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:8-11; Deuteronomy 5:12-14; Leviticus 26).
¥ What is the Greeting on Shabbat?
• Jews greet each other as the Sabbath is arriving each week with this phrase, “Shabbat Shalom”. The word “shalom” has many meanings in English, including, “hello”, “goodbye” and of course “peace”. Shabbat is the Hebrew word for Saturday. So literally “Shabbat Shalom” is a wish for a “peaceful Shabbat”. It’s a very happy blessing to wish someone as everyone is thrilled when Shabbat – the day of rest – arrives.
¥ When is Shabbat?
• Shabbat starts from an hour before sundown on Friday evening and continues until sunset, with the appearance of three stars, on Saturday night – all in all, 25 hours. The beginning of Shabbat is marked by the lighting of two Shabbat candles with your eyes closed which involves blessings for the Shabbat. My wife Janice leads this & it is tradition for the lady of house. The moment you open your eyes and see the two flames of holiness a feeling of peacefulness (Shalom) fills the home.
• Shabbat is an official day of rest coming from the Bible: Genesis 2:2-3 which states “And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.” (painting by Israeli artist Alex Levin) #fbisrael",against

The Zionists were the ones who started the war on Palestine in 1917, when the American politician Balfour gave a promise to the Zionists to establish a state called Israel in the land of Palestine. When Europe expelled them, and they did not find a place to take refuge, they came to Palestine to wage a war against it under the pretext that the land is the land of their ancestors, and in The truth is that they are just the scum of Europe who have not found their place, and with great support from America, they are bombing and destroying everything for the sake of ethnic cleansing, as they say, or rather the brutality and animality, with which they were created.

"Israel was not used for that area in ancient times. It is a well-known fact that ancient extra-biblical sources about the name “Israel,” intended as a place name set in the southern Levant, are few and of debatable value. Use of the name to refer to ancient history is an anachronism. In his book ""The history of Israel"" (Harper, 1960), Biblical scholar Martin Noth observes:

“An authentic and original name for this land as a whole has not come down to us from Old Testament times, and presumably no such ever existed; since as a natural phenomenon it was never a homogeneous, self-contained entity and was never occupied by a homogeneous population, and it was hardly at any time the scene of a political organization which substantially coincided with its actual area. So, the expression 'the land of Israel' may serve as a somewhat flexible description of the area which the Israelite tribes had their settlements”

Palestine defined a larger region, of which Judea or Israel were only a part. Palestinians are not claiming Palestine because they are Muslims or/and Arabs, they do so because they are the indigenous people of Palestine.
Even before Abraham fled from land of Ur, in today Iraq, to the land of Canaan Philistines (Palestine) in ca 2000 BCE.
The Old Testament confirms this fact like in Genesis 21:22-17, the land was called land of Canaan Philistines
""Abraham agrees to a covenant of kindness with Abimelech, the Philistine king, and his descendants. Abraham's son Isaac deals with the Philistine king similarly, by concluding a treaty with them""

Abimelek / Abimelech , ""my father is a king"" is a generic name given to all Philistine kings from the time of Abraham through King David (ca. 1000 BCE). The Hebrew Bible confirms this too; we can read in 1 Samuel 27:
""King David joins with the Philistine king Achish""
""But David thought to himself, one of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines""
""Then David said to Achish, If I have found favour in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”
""David lived in Philistine territory a year and four month""

That means, there were Philistine kings and a land called Palestine, even

before and to the time of Abraham (ca 2000 BCE) when he fled there from land if Ur, today Iraq

before Jacob and his family fled to Egypt (ca 1900 BCE)

before the Hebrew slaves from Egypt fled to the land of Canaan Palestine (ca 1300 BCE)

before David occupied the city Ursalim (ca 1000 BCE) and changed its name. According to the narrative of 2 Samuel 5 ""Mount Zion held the Jebusite fortress of the same name
that was conquered by David and was renamed the City of David"". Even Zion is not a Hebrew word !!!

before the Hebrews started to change the historical facts and to steal the Canaanite Philistinian land, history, culture and even the language.

The name Palestine or Philistine came into widely use when the Ionian Greek historian Herodotus (“the father of history”, ca . 450 BC), mentioned that the land was always called Palestine and not Israel or Judea, Herodotus even didn't mention king David or Salomon or Jews, although supposedly this people had been very well known and powerful for centuries!!!!

The Romans borrowed the name as Palaestina and that was the name used in writings such as those of Ovid, Philo and Josephus. The name of the province continued into the Byzantine era with the provinces of Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda and Palaestina Felix. When the region was conquered by the Muslims in 635, the Arab name Jund Falasteen was used. The Ottomans also used the name Filastin in Turkish. The natives have always used the name Falasteen.

For thousands of years all kingdoms, empires, people and nations called it Philistine and Palestine and never Israel.
Israel is a short-term nothing in the long history of Palestine …. It is a recent British American colony invention based on ancient myth…

Recently, my kids wanted to know what I'm doing to help the war effort in Israel. They see I'm not in green army fatigues and don't have a gun. ""So what do you do?"" they asked me with a puzzled look.

I told them that ""a lot of people overseas want to know how they can help. How are they supposed to know how? So, I speak to people on the frontlines doing good work helping others, and I share their story with daily email updates"".

Welcome to my reserve duty wielding the power of the pen at Kosher Giving.

Working with many volunteers and led by the staff at Sector4 Strategy (where I work), we got a website and free daily updates up and running from scratch since the outbreak of the war.

Frankly, it beats reading gloomy news. Interviewing incredible people doing serious work on the frontlines of civil society reminds me of the tremendous unity and mutual support that has been amplified since the war broke out and the reason we are going to win.

Even my daughter knows it- that's a picture of her sidewalk chalk drawing she made. It says, ""We will win""!

1. There was a time when Israelis came as guests to Egypt during the rule of Prophet Yusuf (A) when they were good people. Similarly Israelis came to Palestine as guests.
2. Later history changed. Pharova came and enslaved them. The suitation continued for very long. Same like fake israel (pharova) doing to Palestinians today.
3. Then one day pharova had seen a dream, that a boy will be born to his second class citizens and will destroy him.
4. He decided to kill every boy born into Israel. You see that parallel?. They specifically target Palestinian kids, in order to reduce Palestinians.
5. But sorry, the boy was finally born and brought up under his watch. Lets see when is that going to happen.
6. The boy Moosa (A), asked in plain language to the head of govt pharova multiple times, to save them. But he didn't listen.
7. Moosa (A) took his people across red sea while pharova attacked. And in the end Pharova and people dead in sea.

A Light to the Nations

After blessing each of the tribes individually, Moses blessed the Jewish people collectively, contrasting their role in the world with that of all other nations.

לָךְ וְאַתָּה עַל בָּמוֹתֵימוֹ תִדְרֹךְ: (דברים לג:כח–כט)
[Moses said of the Jewish people,] “Israel will dwell safely and individually. . . . Your enemies will lie to you [pretending to be your friends], but you will tread upon their heights.” Deuteronomy 33:28-29

Moses here referred prophetically to a non-Jewish nation who pretended to be the Jewish people’s ally after witnessing the miraculous fall of Jericho.

These verses encapsulate the attitudes that we, as Jews, should cultivate vis-à-vis our relationship with the rest of humanity. First, we must realize that we have a unique purpose in this world that sets us apart. We are Jews intrinsically, because of the mission that God has charged us with – not because of anything that others may say about us or do to us.

With this self-assurance, we can then proceed to help the rest of humanity realize its potential. Respectfully, but firmly, we must help them eliminate any residual negativity or antagonism toward Divinity. Then, we can show them how to join us in bringing the world to its ultimate fulfillment, transforming it into God’s true home.

"Cyrus is a king mentioned more than 30 times in the Bible and is identified as Cyrus the Great (also Cyrus II or Cyrus the Elder) who reigned over Persia between 539—530 BC. This pagan king is important in Jewish history because it was under his rule that Jews were first allowed to return to Israel after 70 years of captivity.

In one of the most amazing prophecies of the Bible, the Lord revealed Cyrus’s decree to free the Jews to Isaiah. One hundred fifty years before Cyrus lived, the prophet calls him by name and gives details of Cyrus’s benevolence to the Jews: “This is what the Lord says to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of to subdue nations before him . . . ‘I summon you by name and bestow on you a title of honor, though you do not acknowledge me’” (Isaiah 45:1, 4; see also 41:2-25; 42:6). Evincing His sovereignty over all nations, God says of Cyrus, “He is my shepherd and will accomplish all that I please” (Isaiah 44:28).

Cyrus’s decree releasing the Jewish people, in fulfillment of prophecy, is recorded in 2 Chronicles 36:22–23: “Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing: ‘Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, “The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever is among you of all his people, may the LORD his God be with him. Let him go up.”’” Other Old Testament books that mention Cyrus include Ezra and Daniel.

King Cyrus actively assisted the Jews in rebuilding the temple in Jerusalem under Zerubbabel and Joshua the high priest. Cyrus restored the temple treasures to Jerusalem and allowed building expenses to be paid from the royal treasury (Ezra 1:4–11; 6:4–5). Cyrus’s beneficence helped to restart the temple worship practices that had languished during the 70 years of the Jews’ captivity. Some commentators point to Cyrus’s decree to rebuild Jerusalem as the official beginning of Judaism.

Among the Jews deported from Judah and later placed under the rule of Cyrus include the prophet Daniel. In fact, we are told Daniel served until at least the third year of King Cyrus, approximately 536 BC (Daniel 10:1). That being the case, Daniel likely had some personal involvement in the decree that was made in support of the Jews. The historian Josephus says that Cyrus was informed of the biblical prophecies written about him (Antiquities of the Jews, XI.1.2). The natural person to have shown Cyrus the scrolls was Daniel, a high-ranking official in Persia (Daniel 6:28).

Besides his dealings with the Jews, Cyrus is known for his advancement of human rights, his brilliant military strategy, and his bridging of Eastern and Western cultures. He was a king of tremendous influence and a person God used to help fulfill an important Old Testament prophecy. God’s use of Cyrus as a “shepherd” for His people illustrates the truth of Proverbs 21:1, “The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD; he directs it like a watercourse wherever he pleases.”",against

Press Statement

*The power outage in the Indonesian hospital is a crime against humanity. We call on the Arab and Islamic countries and the United Nations to remedy it urgently.*

The power outage from the Indonesian hospital in the northern Gaza Strip due to the lack of fuel is a crime against humanity, and a disgrace to the countries that remained silent and participated in the occupation’s aggression and the genocide it is committing against our people and defenseless civilians.

We call on our Arab and Islamic countries and the United Nations to take urgent and immediate action to provide fuel supplies to operate electrical generators for hospitals, and we warn against the consequences of negligence in providing fuel, which means condemning all sick and wounded people to death in hospitals.

This is 81 year old Yair Levy who still volunteers for the IDF reserves for 30 years after his mandatory reserve duty already ended! 🫡

30 years ago his son Eyal, who served in Golani, was killed in an ambush in southern Lebanon. After his son's death he decided to return to reserve duty and follow in his son's footsteps. Since then he has been serving in the ""Carmeli"" reserve brigade.

After the Hamas massacre occurred, Yair received an IDF call up order (Tzav 8). He did not think twice and got his army equipment which belonged to his late son and left to join the brigade.

He gives lectures on battle to various army companies as well as gives motivational talks and encouragement to the soldiers.

"A double miracle!
Listen to the amazing story of Noa and Naam Hanukkah from Kibbutz Meflasim.

On that black Saturday, Neam went out to work, from Kibbutz Meflasim, to Ashkelon and was shot by a terrorist squad.
Noa, his wife, nine months of pregnancy, stayed at home.

Within a few minutes, alarms started at a crazy pace and she challenged herself to the dimension, at this time she received a call from Naam ""Noa sorry, they shot me.""

Noam got out of the car and sought help, an officer passing by picked him up in the direction of Barzilai Hospital. On the way, they encountered more terrorists, and the officer was also shot. At this stage, Noa had already understood that dozens of terrorists had infiltrated Kibbutz, and she only wanted to know that Naam was saved. He calls her again and she realizes the officer has been shot and is missing, she is pleading with him to get help and stay alive.

At this stage the first miracle happened, Shlomi Shashi from the kibbutz heard the sirens and returned to levels. On the way saw Neam injured in the car. Without thinking twice, he got out of his car, got into the officer's vehicle and took Noam to the hospital.

At the same time, the water went down to Noa. The Kibbutz paramedic and the brave readiness class, managed to rescue Noa and send her to the hospital. Noa lay down next to Na'am, when he was asleep and breathing and was afraid that she had lost both him and their baby.

About a week ago the second miracle happened - Naam woke up, and a few days later, on 18.10, the anniversary of Naam and Noa, their son was born.

Congratulations Noa and Naam!

"IT HAS BEEN A MONTH SINCE THE OCTOBER 7th MASSACRE OF ISRAELI CITIZENS!
The weeks came and went in a blur. Israel launched its ground offensive and surrounded Gaza City. Yet no matter the progress of war on the front lines, the landscape of Israel remains forever changed.
In the past month, during which I have spent time on the Gaza border, in northern Israel, in Jerusalem, and in Tel Aviv, I was also in the sun-drenched fields near Gaza, in the communities destroyed and in those evacuated. The trauma across Israel is difficult to describe. The most noticeable difference is not the sight of funerals or similar gatherings; rather, in many cases, it is the absence of people.
Streets are quiet. Drivers don’t use their horns the way they used to. Parking lots in Tel Aviv near the beach are deserted. The city’s HaYarkon park, usually full of activities, feels abandoned, as if it has returned to nature. The beaches are almost empty. Bars and restaurants have lost their usual clamor.
Posters for the hostages are everywhere. Outside Tel Aviv’s Habima Theater, a display of empty beds has been left outside, symbolizing the empty beds of the hostages. Some people adorn their bags and bikes with yellow ribbons. People walk quietly among the posters, like ghosts.
At Tel Aviv’s Azrieli Center, the giant flashing billboard that usually displays ads for chocolate or fashion accessories now shows the kidnapped children and adults held in Gaza. A construction site is adorned with a poster of a giant lion emblazoned with the Israeli flag.
There is a juxtaposition here of mourning, demands for the return of the hostages, and patriotism, and they do not necessarily go hand-in-hand. People have been flocking to support our soldiers. The whole country seems to be either under arms or in support of the war effort.On the other hand, it is also quiet and somber; there is no cheering for this war. There is hope that the soldiers will return, but not yet a sense of victory.

—- Evacuees from the South and North —-
In both the South and the North, communities have been evacuated – around 100 border communities and two cities – totaling at least 200,000 people who have left their homes; some because their communities were destroyed by Hamas, and any others because they were provided a place to go and encouraged to leave. They have moved to hundreds of guest houses and hotels across Israel.
Eilat is swelled by an additional 60,000 people. This means that the closer one gets to the borders, the more empty they appear. People still work the fields, thanks to volunteers who have come to help the communities. The locals have been replaced by the army, as tanks replace tractors, APCs replace SUVs, and Humvees replace cars. And all manner of this menagerie of vehicles is on the roads; from fuel trucks to Humvees that are decades old to the ancient M113 APCs that date from the Vietnam era. These vehicles seem more fitting for a movie set as they drive around fields like armadillos plodding along.
And the army keeps moving. At Urim Junction, where several weeks ago the air was filled with the smell of meat being grilled for soldiers, the soldiers have moved on, like a nomadic tribe that has picked up their tents and migrated.
IN WAR, everything is temporary. A bivouac here, a few tanks there, some training to be done in this field and then in that field. And they leave things behind. A tank that was unloaded in the early days of the war near Yad Mordechai left tracks on the road. Tanks aren’t supposed to drive on civilian roads because they chew up the concrete. But war is war, and roads must suffer. Fields must also suffer; it isn’t melon season near the Gaza border this time, so the tanks have had the good luck of not churning up fields full of crops. Instead, perhaps, they have helped prepare the soil for the next planting.
The sounds of war are changing as well. A month into it, the rocket attacks from Gaza appear to be reduced. Some 10,000 have been fired, but half of those were fired in the first days. Today, the enemy can fire a barrage a day from Gaza. But there are other threats – from Hezbollah and other Iran-backed groups in Syria and Yemen.
The landscape is not the same. In the South, many communities now have security checks at their entrances. The security threat seems to be ever-present. In the North, they have had to add shelters to places because some communities don’t have enough. Tel Aviv is full of posters of the missing hostages. Jerusalem is quiet, but somewhat lacks the posters that are so common in Tel Aviv. Perhaps this is a reminder that behind the unity and calls for victory, the cities and towns are not all the same. The country is unified for now. But the differences are here beneath the surface! Jerusalem Post #fbisrael",against
"Pro-Palestinian woman asking how can Palestinians defend themselves without being called terrorists. Let's ask this question ourselves- Thousands of armed men blow a fence during a cease-fire, enter a music festival where they rape and murder peace-loving partygoers, then go into every town in the towns by the border, enter people's residents torture them, murder them, burn them alive, kill their pets just for a laugh, steal what they have left and take hostages from all ages - some are volunteers driving Gazan kids to Israeli hospitals. does this sound like self-defense or terrorism to you? How about an organized army running to the party, running to the towns, trying to stop those infiltrated and save the civilians under attack, then go back to save their pets, then give 2 weeks' notice to all innocent people in Gaza to leave so they can stop only those responsible for the attack and bring back the hostages.

With Donald Trump coming to power in January 2017, serious changes were made in American foreign policy; According to these changes, the Middle East region also underwent important changes. One of the most important events in this region is related to the issue of occupied Palestine and the evolution of the proposed peace plans. The Trump administration, which had a Jewish nature more than other American administrations and expressed great closeness to the Jews of occupied Palestine, under the influence of the strategies of Zionist-influenced think tanks in America, has introduced a plan that, according to Donald Trump, will be the deal of the century. Donald Trump had announced that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the most difficult issue in the world and if a solution is found, it will be the deal of the century. This plan, which was presented in the media six months after Trump's presidency, intends to establish a new government under the name of the new Palestinian government by providing some economic privileges to the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinians living in Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon.

Palestine, a nation that has faced countless challenges and struggles, continues to amaze the world with its unwavering spirit. Despite the hardships and injustices they endure on a daily basis, the people of Palestine greet each day with smiles on their faces, spreading positivity and resilience to everyone they encounter.

Their smiles are not merely expressions of happiness; they are symbols of resistance and defiance against oppression. In the face of adversity, they find solace in their unwavering determination to build a better future for themselves and their loved ones.

It is a testament to the indomitable human spirit that, even in the midst of their own struggles, the people of Palestine find the strength to uplift others. Their smiles are a reminder that kindness, compassion, and unity have the power to transcend borders and bring people together.

According to witnesses at the scene, a verbal altercation broke out between an older Jewish man and a young pro-Palestinian protester. Suddenly, the protester struck the older man in the head with a megaphone he was holding.
The injured man fell to the ground bleeding and was rushed to the hospital. His death was confirmed to have been caused due to a brain hemorrhage.

"Opinion

Causes of Wars: Hatred is Learned from Childhood to Adulthood

Why do wars erupt? The question is complex, but one key factor undoubtedly lies in how children are raised and taught. Often, behind wars, there is deeply ingrained hatred and a misunderstanding of religion, as well as historical injustices that justify revenge, regardless of how old the mistreatment may be.

Childhood plays a pivotal role in shaping individuals, manipulating them, and brainwashing them by providing perceptions of the world and others. If children are raised to hate and fear differences, it becomes difficult or even impossible for them as young adults to understand other cultures and religions. They may not question their leaders or mentors.

In many conflicts, the roots lie in teaching children and young people to believe that only their own religion and agenda are correct, while others are wrong.

Wars do not arise out of thin air. They stem from long-term cultivation of hatred and prejudices. It would be essential to invest in children’s education and teaching that emphasizes understanding, tolerance, and intercultural dialogue. However, this may not be very realistic even in the coming centuries.

It would require raising children to love diversity and appreciate multiculturalism. PERHAPS this would reduce the causes of wars and facilitate the birth of peace in a more sustainable way.

The goals of the following organizations are related to achieving a peaceful and sustainable solution to the Middle East conflict. What are their results, and how should individuals around the world do more than just express their opinions on social media or other platforms?

International organizations, including:

1. United Nations (UN): UN institutions, such as the UN Special Envoy in the Middle East, have played a central role in peace negotiations and humanitarian aid in the region.
2. The Quartet: The Quartet is a group composed of representatives from the United Nations, the European Union, Russia, and the United States. It has supported peace negotiations in the Middle East.
3. Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement: International Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations have provided humanitarian assistance and support to conflict victims in the area.
4. European Union: The EU has been involved in the peace process and has offered both political support and financial aid to promote peace and stability in the Middle East.
5. Arab League: The Arab League has participated in the Middle East peace process and supported Palestinian efforts to gain recognition and independence.

These are examples of international organizations, along with many others.

Local organizations, including:

1. Shalom Achshav (Peace Now): This is an organization operating in Israel that seeks to promote peace and supports a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine.
2. Givat Haviva: Givat Haviva promotes dialogue and understanding among different population groups in Israel, especially between Jews and Arabs.
3. The Parents Circle - Families Forum: This organization consists of Israeli and Palestinian families who have lost loved ones in the conflict. They work for reconciliation and peace.
4. OneVoice: This organization aims to engage young people and young adults in the peace process in Israel and Palestine.
5. B’Tselem: A human rights organization that monitors the human rights situation in the West Bank and Gaza and seeks to expose human rights abuses.

In addition to these, the actions of various states, where differences between different states are a given due to decision-making, the nature of legislation, and the processes of governance. The above are commonly referred to as politics. Initiating war or acts of terror is a political decision, regardless of the reasons, whether they stem from history, revenge, religion, power, money, or any other cause.

The individual’s opinion holds no significance because the media and channels from which information is obtained are unreliable. Although one may present their thoughts with all their wisdom and expertise, there is always someone with a differing view.

Approximately 50 terrorists were eliminated by Israeli forces. Furthermore, Israeli fighter jets, under Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) intelligence, killed Ebrahim Biari, the commander of Hamas's Jabalya battalion, and was one of the leaders of the October 7 massacre.

The stronghold was used by Biari for training in preparation for terrorist operations. There were infrastructures and terror tunnels at the place that were used for terrorists to move to the coastal area.

On Friday in Aneby, a single manifestation was held to show support for the tragic events that took place in Israel on October 7th.

The darkness of these events calls upon us to take a stand against such acts and fight for innocent people. I need your help with this cause. The manifestation was pre-arranged by the police, and only a camera was used to record the event. Every citizen in Sweden has the right to express themselves differently.

Dear citizen of Aneby,

I am writing to express my overwhelming feelings regarding an attack on me that occurred while I was standing in front of the municipality. In such situations, I try to remain positive and be a source of light for innocent people. Unfortunately, the incident exposed clear cases of anti-Semitism and discrimination. However, I stood strong and voiced my support for justice.

Sadly, the local newspaper in Aneby did not accurately inform the public about the incident, and I felt that they devalued and demeaned my experience. It is essential to note that there are no charges against me from the police. Police unit in tranas has been charged for crime as well !

I find comfort in the teachings of the Bible, which remind us that the light and grace of God within us, through Jesus Christ, is stronger than any enemy outside.

Thank you for taking the time to read this message.

"""🎵 Aside from that, we don’t need a thing”

Israel Tour Guide - Sam Gorenshten
November 3 at 6:16 PM ·

Shabbat Shalom to all mt friends around the world..

""🎵 Aside from that, we don’t need a thing” by Shlomo Artzi originated after the Six-Day War, inspired by his fallen friend Koren. The song, now a modern prayer in some Jewish circles, is a tribute at IDF memorials.

In 2006, Artzi dedicated it to Elad Regev, Ehud Goldwasser, and Gilad Shelly, abducted by Hezbollah. When Goldwasser returned in a casket, the song's message hit home: 'Let us see him again - We don't need more.'
In 2010, Artzi performed it in a heartfelt 'Cry Concert to the World' for Gilad Shalit, held captive for four years. This line turned into a powerful cry and prayer."" 🙏🎶
There are currently 242 kidnapped babies, children, women, elders, and men in Gaza.

🙏🙏Join in a prayer to Bring Them Home Now. 🙏🙏
The complete lyrics of the song:
Our eyes are already dried out of tears, and our mouth is now mute, voiceless.
What more can we ask for, tell us what more? We already asked for almost everything.

Give us rain when the time is right, and in the spring, sprinkle flowers around us, and let him return to his home.
Deep down we’ve hidden a sigh. Our eyes are already dried out from crying. Tell us we’ve already passed the test.

Give us rain when the time is right, and in the spring, sprinkle flowers around us, and let her be with him again.
We don’t need more.
We’ve already covered a grave mound or two, we buried our hearts among the cypresses.

Our sigh will soon break through – Take it as a personal prayer.
Give us rain when the time is right, and in the spring, sprinkle flowers around us.
And let us see him again –
We don’t need more.",against

— BREAKING NEWS ✡️ Pro-Palestinian protestor murders Jewish man Paul Kessler, age 65, from Thousand Oaks California. He died as a result of a brain injury he suffered after a verbal altercation he had with a pro-Palestinian protestor at Westlake Village.
According to witnesses at the scene, a verbal altercation broke out between an older Jewish man and a young pro-Palestinian protester. Suddenly, the protester struck the older man in the head with a megaphone he was holding.
The injured man fell to the ground bleeding and was rushed to the hospital. His death was confirmed to have been caused due to a brain hemorrhage. Israelis who were present at the scene described it as ""a terrifying sight"" and expressed shock that such an incident took place in their neighborhood.
The incident was filmed on the victims' mobile device and has been seized by local police as evidence in their investigation into the incident. While the police have confirmed the case was being looked into, they haven't provided further details at this time, including whether the suspect has been arrested.
The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles said the Jewish community is ״devastated to learn of the tragic death of an elderly Jewish man who was struck in the head by a megaphone wielded by a pro-Palestinian protestor in Westlake Village. Our hearts are with the family of the victim. While we wait for more information from our lay enforcement partners, we remind you that this is the fourth major antisemitic crime committed in Los Angeles this year alone. Violence against our people has no place in civilized society. We demand safety. We will not tolerate violence against our community. We will do everything in our power to prevent it.״ ynet news #fbisrael",against

"We formed the Hostage and Missing Families Forum Less than 24 hours after the horrific attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7th, in which thousands of innocent civilians
were murdered and taken hostage by Hamas. The Forum is volunteer-based and laser-focused on bringing the hostages back home to their families, to us.

The forum offers families holistic support and professional assistance and advances the ongoing efforts through all channels, locally, regionally and globally, to bring the hostages and the missing back home to their loved ones.

Demanding the release of innocent hostages does not require bravery, it is not political either. Many of the hostages are children, women and the elderly. We demand to bring them home now.

Counting thousands of volunteers and supporters, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum includes family members and friends of the hostages alongside top security, law, media and diplomacy experts who are donating their time to the cause.

Donations are directed towards advancing all necessary efforts to raise awareness, create campaigns in Israel and abroad, and end the hostage situation in a speedy manner. We invite you to support us at this difficult time and stand by the innocent civilians and their families in a clear demand to #BringThemHomeNow!

This is must-see TV, @lalshareef refuting #miakhalifah with facts 😁 رد على مزاعم ميا خليفة

It is absolutely incredible how many people are brainwashed and don’t even stop for a second to research even the smallest bit of history of the Jewish people and their ancestral homeland, the place that they are indigenous to -> Israel.

It was only in the 2nd century CE, that the Romans crushed the revolt of Shimon Bar Kokhba (132 CE), during which Jerusalem and Judea were conquered, and the area of Judea was renamed Palaestina in an attempt to minimize Jewish identification with the land of Israel.

Even the Dome of the Rock located at our Kotel (the western wall) sits on top of our Holy Temple(s), not the other way around.

Like you, I don’t like to see this woman’s face - a woman who has fully given herself over to the powers of the evil inclination, the other side of Godliness, the other side of light, the other side of truth - but she has double the number of followers on Instagram than the number of Jews in the world and it’s important to educate people and this video by Loay Lalshareef directed at her perpetual lies does exactly that.

Everyone who shares posts against the Children of Israel and the Jews right to exist in the land is only following in the footsteps of the Romans and distancing themselves from truth, justice, light, and redemption.🪬🤍🧿🕊️",against

"Arab colonization started in the 7th and 8th centuries when Arab armies conquered vast territories across the Middle East and North Africa. The process began with the Islamic expansion following the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE. The initial conquests were led by the Rashidun Caliphate, followed by the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties.

The Arab people originate from the Arabian Peninsula, which is mainly located in present-day Saudi Arabia. The Arabian Peninsula was inhabited by various Arabian tribes, including the Quraysh tribe to which the Prophet Muhammad belonged. From the Arabian Peninsula, Arabs spread across the region through trade, migration, and later through military conquests.

Recently, my kids wanted to know what I'm doing to help the war effort in Israel. They see I'm not in green army fatigues and don't have a gun. ""So what do you do?"" they asked me with a puzzled look.

I told them that ""a lot of people overseas want to know how they can help. How are they supposed to know how? So, I speak to people on the frontlines doing good work helping others, and I share their story with daily email updates"".

Welcome to my reserve duty wielding the power of the pen at Kosher Giving.

Working with many volunteers and led by the staff at Sector4 Strategy (where I work), we got a website and free daily updates up and running from scratch since the outbreak of the war.

Frankly, it beats reading gloomy news. Interviewing incredible people doing serious work on the frontlines of civil society reminds me of the tremendous unity and mutual support that has been amplified since the war broke out and the reason we are going to win.

Even my daughter knows it- that's a picture of her sidewalk chalk drawing she made. It says, ""We will win""!

"🚨ISRAEL REALTIME: SHABBAT ALERT INFO:🚨
SHABBAT INSTRUCTIONS for those in ISRAEL
Chief Rabbinute instructions with High Risk adjustments:

Parshat Vayera - SHABBAT in Israel starts tonight at 4:31 PM and ends at 5:26 PM Saturday night (+/- a few minutes depending on where in Israel.)

-> You MUST have a way to hear alerts, including INFILTRATION alerts.

-> Is your area safe to go to synagogue?
— Follow instructions of Homefront Command and Your City Council! If instructed to stay home or to stay in shelter, DO NOT go to synagogue unless the synagogue is in a shelter.

-> Know the safe path TO / FROM synagogue
— If an alert goes off, where will you go to be protected on the way? Plan your route.

-> IN synagogue, where is shelter? Does it have capacity?
— If an alert goes off in synagogue, KNOW where you will go. Walk over and check the path and capacity. PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT THIS SHABBAT — If it has no shelter or not enough capacity, choose another or pray at home.

-> ARE YOU TOO SLOW, stay home to be safe.
— Elderly, sick, disabled, young children, parents with multiple children, DO NOT pray in synagogue (unless the synagogue is in a shelter).

-> CHILDREN?
— Older children should be instructed how to be safe. Younger children are at risk! Will you have time to find them and get them to safety? What if you have multiple children to attend? LEAVE THEM HOME.

-> CARRY YOUR WEAPON.
— If you have a gun license, it is a MITZVAH to carry your gun on Shabbat, even without an eruv.
— Try to have AT LEAST one armed person in every synagogue.
— Pepper spray? Knife? Carry it - we are all at life risk in this war!

-> IF SIRENS, SHELTER EVEN IF IN AMIDAH
— If sirens are heard in the middle of the Amidah, one must go to the shelter. After, restart Amidah from the beginning.
— Can’t get to shelter, LAY DOWN, all the way, hands on head (reduces risk by 80%).
— As per Homefront Command, wait AT LEAST 5 minutes (Homefront says 10) before existing shelter or getting up.

-> HAVE A PHONE AVAILALBLE
— Every synagogue needs a PHONE ON for immediate use on Shabbat. And preferably with a red alert app in case it is hard to hear sirens.
— You may carry and keep a cell phone on in your pocket. Set to silent, and set red alert apps to “override silent mode”.

-> DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL POLICE !!
— If anything suspicious, CALL POLICE immediately! Dial 100

-> All instructions of Home Front Command and your City/Council must be strictly obeyed. If instructed to shut yourself in, do not leave the house at all, not even for prayer.

-> Those who live in settlements or towns near confrontation areas MUST leave their phones on to receive emergency messages from the town. Leave phone on, read if a message alert arrives! Pikuach Nefesh mamash!

It is a mitzvah to take actions to protect and save and preserve life on Shabbat, not a violation. But ONLY actions which do so.

May we all have peace and safety on Shabbat! May our soldiers be EFFECTIVE and return home safe. And may our hostages be returned safe, healthy and whole.

"Israel belongs to the jews.

We forget that any land we possess is not our own but God alone. It is God who gave the land of israel to the jews. According to the Quran is explicitly states that we are to listen to the Gospels and the Torah. What does the Gospels say. The Gospels says that God the Supreme gave israel his first born to the jews. What God give he can take away. Everything belongs to God alone. Job 1:21 says and said, “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.” we know based on this verse that what God gives he can also take away.

What is the land that God promised to Israel?

There is probably no more disputed real estate on earth than the land of Israel. Even calling it “Israel” will raise objections from some quarters. The Jewish people lay claim to the land because they first held possession of it millennia ago and because God directly gave them the land, as recorded in the Bible.

In Genesis 12:7, God promises Abram, who had just arrived in Canaan, “To your offspring I will give this land.” Later, in Genesis 15:18, God expands on that unconditional promise: “To your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates” (NASB). Then, in Genesis 17:8, God reiterates the promise to Abraham, adding that the land gift is irrevocable: “The whole land of Canaan, where you now reside as a foreigner, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you.” God later repeats the promise to Abraham’s son Isaac (Genesis 26:3–4) and Isaac’s son Jacob (Genesis 28:13), whose name God later changed to Israel.

In the Abrahamic Covenant, then, God laid out the extent of the land that would belong to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—a territory including all of Canaan and stretching from Egypt to modern-day Iraq. Several centuries later, when it came time for the Israelites actually take possession of the Promised Land, God again spoke of a vast area “from the Negev wilderness in the south to the Lebanon mountains in the north, from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, including all the land of the Hittites” (Joshua 1:4, NLT).

The promise of land belonging to the children of Israel is permanent. Even when Israel was expelled from their land, which has happened twice in history, God promised they would return: “Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the LORD your God will gather you and bring you back. He will bring you to the land that belonged to your ancestors, and you will take possession of it” (Deuteronomy 30:4–5). This promise is part of what is today sometimes called the Palestinian Covenant or the Land Covenant (Deuteronomy 29:1—30:10).",against

"Israel was not used for that area in ancient times. It is a well-known fact that ancient extra-biblical sources about the name “Israel,” intended as a place name set in the southern Levant, are few and of debatable value. Use of the name to refer to ancient history is an anachronism. In his book ""The history of Israel"" (Harper, 1960), Biblical scholar Martin Noth observes:

“An authentic and original name for this land as a whole has not come down to us from Old Testament times, and presumably no such ever existed; since as a natural phenomenon it was never a homogeneous, self-contained entity and was never occupied by a homogeneous population, and it was hardly at any time the scene of a political organization which substantially coincided with its actual area. So, the expression 'the land of Israel' may serve as a somewhat flexible description of the area which the Israelite tribes had their settlements”

Palestine defined a larger region, of which Judea or Israel were only a part. Palestinians are not claiming Palestine because they are Muslims or/and Arabs, they do so because they are the indigenous people of Palestine.
Even before Abraham fled from land of Ur, in today Iraq, to the land of Canaan Philistines (Palestine) in ca 2000 BCE.
The Old Testament confirms this fact like in Genesis 21:22-17, the land was called land of Canaan Philistines
""Abraham agrees to a covenant of kindness with Abimelech, the Philistine king, and his descendants. Abraham's son Isaac deals with the Philistine king similarly, by concluding a treaty with them""

Abimelek / Abimelech , ""my father is a king"" is a generic name given to all Philistine kings from the time of Abraham through King David (ca. 1000 BCE). The Hebrew Bible confirms this too; we can read in 1 Samuel 27:
""King David joins with the Philistine king Achish""
""But David thought to himself, one of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines""
""Then David said to Achish, If I have found favour in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”
""David lived in Philistine territory a year and four month""

That means, there were Philistine kings and a land called Palestine, even

before and to the time of Abraham (ca 2000 BCE) when he fled there from land if Ur, today Iraq

before Jacob and his family fled to Egypt (ca 1900 BCE)

before the Hebrew slaves from Egypt fled to the land of Canaan Palestine (ca 1300 BCE)

before David occupied the city Ursalim (ca 1000 BCE) and changed its name. According to the narrative of 2 Samuel 5 ""Mount Zion held the Jebusite fortress of the same name
that was conquered by David and was renamed the City of David"". Even Zion is not a Hebrew word !!!

before the Hebrews started to change the historical facts and to steal the Canaanite Philistinian land, history, culture and even the language.

The name Palestine or Philistine came into widely use when the Ionian Greek historian Herodotus (“the father of history”, ca . 450 BC), mentioned that the land was always called Palestine and not Israel or Judea, Herodotus even didn't mention king David or Salomon or Jews, although supposedly this people had been very well known and powerful for centuries!!!!

The Romans borrowed the name as Palaestina and that was the name used in writings such as those of Ovid, Philo and Josephus. The name of the province continued into the Byzantine era with the provinces of Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda and Palaestina Felix. When the region was conquered by the Muslims in 635, the Arab name Jund Falasteen was used. The Ottomans also used the name Filastin in Turkish. The natives have always used the name Falasteen.

For thousands of years all kingdoms, empires, people and nations called it Philistine and Palestine and never Israel.
Israel is a short-term nothing in the long history of Palestine …. It is a recent British American colony invention based on ancient myth…

The British Liberal Democrats have won the most votes for the ban on British trade activities with illegal settlements of the Zionist colonial state in the occupied Palestinian territories.

Photo caption:

The motion passed by the party at its annual conference yesterday included its ""commitment to immediately recognize Palestine as an independent sovereign state by the British government under the 1967 lines."" The motion also asks the British government to prohibit companies from operating in illegal settlements in the occupied territories and to ensure that Palestinians receive the same treatment as citizens of the Zionist occupiers regarding visa-free travel to the UK.

Ambassador Husam Zomlot, head of the Palestinian mission to Britain, took part in the conference and hailed the motion as ""a good first step"".
He urged other British parties not only to follow suit, but also to adopt policies that gave British and international legal force regarding illegal colonial settlements belonging to the Zionist colonial state and the practices of apartheid.

While this building, which belongs to the Palestinians where attending the funeral of Shireen Abu Akleh, Jewish settlers with the full protection of the Zionist Israeli forces start to move their belongings into Palestinian homes.

This video was posted to Twitter by Yishai Fleisher boasting about the theft of property and land.

The Wafa news agency reported that the building belonged to local Palestinian resident Walid al-Ja'abri, and it was undergoing renovations at the time that the Israeli settlers stormed in.

Local sources also said that Israeli soldiers surrounded the building to prevent Palestinian residents from approaching the settlers.

Around 700 Israeli settlers live in settlements in the heart of Hebron, where they are guarded by thousands of Israeli soldiers and police. Hundreds of Palestinian homes have meanwhile been left empty due to restrictions favouring settlers.

Hebron is home to more than 200,000 Palestinians. Israel approved plans two days ago for 4,427 new illegal housing units for Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank.",neutral

"If the fact that Palestinians have been stuck in a literal cage, slaughtered and oppressed for years, having to depend on Israel for every essential need to stay alive. All while America funds both sides. Isn’t enough for some people to see the real evil at play. Then I truly don’t know what is. I’m ashamed and disgusted our American tax dollars are going to white phosphorus and bombs, obliterating children and innocent families. And don’t see how anyone couldn’t be. Especially considering half the people there are children, who never had a choice in any of this! That did nothing more than be born there. A sickening disgrace for humanity! After all if you want to understand how to fix a problem in the world, you have to ask who is profiting/gaining from it. Not who is suffering. I don’t know how anyone is still so brainwashed not to be able to see that. No life is any more important than the next. And it certainly isn’t up to us or the government, to decide that. Not when it comes to innocent lives. Until anyone can tell me what makes Israeli children more deserving of life and equality than Palestinian children. Or even Israeli adults more deserving than Palestinian adults. Then there really isn’t even an argument. The hypocrisy and double standards make me sick. As does the suffering and slaughtering of innocent people. And the people who support it. Some people need to learn where to find accurate information, and a history lesson. Instead of just spewing whatever nonsense the government and media are telling us. That’s especially true for the people saying “Doesn’t Israel have the right to defend itself”, or the even more ill informed “they started it”. To the people condemning others for “supporting terrorists”. Nobody is “supporting terrorists”. We are supporting innocent people who deserve life and equality, just as much as anyone else. To the people saying “you’re antisemitic”. Nope, we are ALL equal. That’s kind of the point, no? And to the people saying “Hamas is using human shields”. You wanna talk about human shields, while comparing free people to people locked in a cage? Let’s talk about how all Israeli citizens are forced to join the military, once 18. Therefore they don’t even have civilians. The only people that get fed more bs and propaganda on this entire planet than us Americans, are Israeli’s. (With North Korea probably being an exception) To anyone to that feeds into this garbage and thinks they are better than, or more important than anyone else on this entire planet. I feel sorry for you! To anyone apathetic because it’s not personally affecting you. Just know that it will one day, one way or another. And probably your children’s and grandchildren’s lives as well. None of us will be spared from our worlds corrupt “leaders” and their greed stricken nefarious intentions. And that only appears truer, everyday. I want to know how many more deaths, land grabs, recessions, and obvious corruption, that need to go on before everyone can see this? And care enough to do something? To anyone defending this. Why don’t you try living the way these people have been forced to, for the past 70 years. Then get back to me! I wish people would stand together and start blaming and holding accountable the people actually oppressing and in control. Instead of blaming and slaughtering each other. Let’s not forget united we stand divided we fall. That stands just as true today, as the day it was first quoted. Regardless of what we are taught and all the propaganda out there! And our differences or beliefs. And lastly to the people all across the globe that can see this situation for what it is. Which is not a conflict or a war. But ethnic cleansing and genocide, that started long before October 7th. Thank you for standing for humanity! Even in the face of judgement and ridicule. And being on the right side of history. You are their hope! ❤️ And our hope. All anyone has to do to see this atrocity is Google the death statistics, be able to think for themselves, and understand we are all equal.

The blockade of the Gaza Strip and occupation of the West Bank have contributed to ongoing tensions in the 21st century.
One of the biggest myths about the Israel-Palestine conflict is that it's been going on for centuries, that this is all about ancient religious hatreds.
In fact, while religion is involved, the conflict is mostly about two groups of people who claim the same land. And it really only goes back about a century, to the early 1900s. At its heart, it is a conflict between two self-determination movements — the Jewish Zionist project and the Palestinian nationalist project — that lay claim to the same territory.

It is absolutely incredible how many people are brainwashed and don’t even stop for a second to research even the smallest bit of history of the Jewish people and their ancestral homeland, the place that they are indigenous to -> Israel.

It was only in the 2nd century CE, that the Romans crushed the revolt of Shimon Bar Kokhba (132 CE), during which Jerusalem and Judea were conquered, and the area of Judea was renamed Palaestina in an attempt to minimize Jewish identification with the land of Israel.

Even the Dome of the Rock located at our Kotel (the western wall) sits on top of our Holy Temple(s), not the other way around.

Like you, I don’t like to see this woman’s face - a woman who has fully given herself over to the powers of the evil inclination, the other side of Godliness, the other side of light, the other side of truth - but she has double the number of followers on Instagram than the number of Jews in the world and it’s important to educate people and this video by Loay Lalshareef directed at her perpetual lies does exactly that.

The targets of the attack were three Palestinian military commanders with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement: Tariq Izz Al-Deen, Khalil Al-Bahtini, and Jihad Al-Ghannam. It is reported that the attack was approved by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant.
Do you support the referral of this matter to the International Court of Justice?

As an expression of my commitment to the Palestinian cause, from all perspectives, especially the humanitarian aspect, and my belief that the Palestinian cause still holds a special place in the hearts of Arab and Islamic nations, as well as all lovers of humanity. I have faith in the oppressed people all over the world, especially in light of the dangerous and tragic situation facing our beloved Gaza, including the cutting off of water and electricity, medical supply shortages, and terrorist attacks on hospitals, the killing of children, women, and civilians without justification or right.
Therefore, based on legal and humanitarian principles, I call upon the Islamic and Arab peoples, and all peace-loving individuals, to assemble peacefully, independently of their governments except for non-interference, for a peaceful gathering at the Palestinian borders alongside Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and even Jordan. This gathering should be without any arms except for shrouds, and it should continue until the siege is lifted and sufficient aid is delivered to our people in Gaza, both in the north and the south. We have no objection to the inspection of this aid by a neutral party agreed upon by all, such as the United Nations or others. If we find cooperation from the people, we will schedule a meeting later, in agreement with all parties, far from governments and military entities.

Thank you

"Yesterday, over 500 workers at Amazon and Google joined forces1 to demand their employers cut ties with Israeli apartheid and end Project Nimbus—a $1.2 billion contract to provide cloud technology for the Israeli military and government.

Google and Amazon execs signed the contract this past May as the Israeli military leveled entire residential buildings,2 clinics,3 and schools4 in Gaza while threatening to push Palestinian families out of their homes in Jerusalem.5

The courageous workers at every level of Amazon and Google are making it very clear that technology should be used to bring people together, not enable ethnic cleansing. They deserve our support.

That's why MPower Change and over 40 organizations just launched the #NoTechForApartheid campaign.

Click here to send an email to Amazon and Google execs & let them know that there’s still time to be on the right side of history: Cut Project Nimbus and stop doing business with Israeli apartheid.
Project Nimbus will make the Israeli military that carries out atrocities in Gaza — and the government that carries out the daily business of apartheid — more oppressive, violent, and deadly for Palestinians.

That’s not hyperbole. Under Project Nimbus, the technology and infrastructure provided by Google and Amazon will make data-powered surveillance of Palestinians more state-of-the-art and make it easier for the Israeli government to force Palestinians off their land. This cloud tech could likely build data capacity for the Israel Land Authority (ILA), the Israeli government agency that manages the expansion of illegal settlement, confines Palestinian communities, and limits their growth.

Both Amazon and Google pay lip service to having human rights commitments. Amazon released Global Human Rights Principles, promising to ""embed respect for human rights throughout our business.""6 Similarly, Google states that companies ""can make money without doing evil.""7

Instead of living those values, Google and Amazon are putting profit ahead of people by powering the Israeli government’s violence against Palestinians.

Demand Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy live up to their human rights commitments and stop facilitating apartheid.

Amazon and Google’s collaboration with Israeli apartheid is part of a larger pattern of Big Tech fueling state violence across the globe.8 Amazon helps power ICE’s deportation-detention machine9 while Google sold artificial intelligence to the Department of Defense to make its drone strikes deadlier.10

But we’ve seen ordinary people and workers fight back and win against contracts like this and win before — and there’s every reason to believe we can make Amazon and Google executives listen to those calling on them to be on the right side of history.

Following in the footsteps of those who fought for divestment from apartheid South Africa and won, it’s our responsibility to rise up in support of Palestinian freedom. We know that, together, we can win, too.

With one click, email Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy now.

We decree God's peace and blessing rests upon Israel and Jerusalem. We declare peace to her borders and that all enemy fire shall cease. We ask for angelic reinforcements to bring protection to the walls of Israel and that its places of government shall remain safe.

We break the power of all dread, fear, and terror among the people. We say they shall not fear attacks, bombings, missiles, and foreign invasion. We prophesy that their homes, streets, businesses, and historical sites shall be protected.

We declare that Israel's land shall remain secure, and no politicians or governments of the earth shall be able to enact agreements or accords that take their land away. We say that Jerusalem belongs to God. We speak strength to the state of Israel. We prophesy that a prosperity from the Lord rests upon it and the Jewish people. Israel belongs to God and Israel is forever.

We declare that the Gospel of Jesus Christ shall shine in Israel and many shall come to the way of salvation.

May the United States of America never break its alliance with Israel. We bind every effort by the government to detach from Israel, and we declare that America shall always defend Israel and seek its good.

We pray for the defeat and destruction of Islamist terrorist invaders. We pray for the physical rescue of Israelis under siege, those who are kidnapped, those who are wounded. We pray for divine wisdom and decisive strategy to be given to Israel's leaders in every area.

We pray that God will break the arrows and bow of the enemy, and for supernatural protection for Israel against all rockets and missile attacks from God and his angels. We pray that Israel’s enemies will be confused and will turn and flee.

We pray for salvation and revival to break out in Israel. We pray that they would come to know Jesus as their true Messiah. We pray that their eyes would be opened to see the love and light of Jesus in the middle of their darkest hour.

God we declare that this conflict will not escalate into World War 3. We declare that it will end quickly and every attempt of the enemy to turn it into something more is cancelled in Jesus’ name. We pray for peace in Israel and worldwide.

The only death sentence ever carried out in Israel was when Adolf Eichmann finally received his well-deserved punishment, but the question is now whether Israel should instate a special law for the Hamas terrorists who participated in the massacre but were captured. There can only be one just punishment for their heinous crime – hang them!

"With the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, I think this article I wrote 5 years ago is worth taking note of, particularly this segment about the claim 'They're killing our children' from Palestinian nationalists and how this term evolved. And how we see it being used shamelessly today in Gaza.
>>>>>>
In the decades following, there was an uncomfortable courtship between the left-wing and the Palestinian cause, mostly due to how it was pursued during that period. After all, however righteous that cause might be, what self-respecting left-winger could, with a clear conscience, support plane hijackings, killing half an Olympic team and blowing apart men, women and children in cafés, hotels, clubs and shopping malls. Paradoxically, it wasn’t until the security divide to protect against this was built between 2002-2006 that the Palestinians were seen as a fully-entrenched and disadvantaged group, and so in turn were perceived by the left-wing as fully deserving of the ‘underdog’ crown previously held by Israel.
In Gaza – where with the withdrawal of settlers, Gazan women gave flowers to Israeli soldiers in thanks – that initial hope faded as Hamas gained control and with continual rocket fire into Israel, the situation became even more entrenched.
In retrospect, one can’t help wonder whether Palestinian leaders – having viewed the reaction in the West to that thirty-year largely civilian-targeted terrorist bombing campaign – helped shaped how they would fight their cause in the future. Certainly with the divide built and future bombing plans seriously hampered, propaganda was probably the only remaining strong option – so it’s easy to see why the Palestinians would make as much of their future civilian losses as they could. As a result, those losses were strongly exaggerated or bent out of shape, and pictures of injured or dead infants displayed at every opportunity. ‘They’re killing our children,’ became a favoured headline. And who can blame them? Having seen their own bombing campaigns against Israelis have a reverse effect and raise nothing but horror in the West, why not dip their bread in some of that same gravy – or in this case, blood – and plumb Western liberal sensitivities as best they could. Perhaps they even thought at one stage: the holocaust helped the Jews gain Israel, playing the victim card might work in a similar way for us too.
So it’s easy to understand why the Palestinians and part of the Arab media pursued this course; after all, with the odds against them in a conventional conflict, what other choice was there? But the position of the liberal left and much of the Western media is not so easy to comprehend. Where were the voices questioning these statistics or this strategy, or indeed stating the obvious: ‘You can hardly complain about civilian losses on your side when for the past thirty years you’ve pursued a terrorist bombing campaign against Israel which has targeted almost exclusively civilians.’ But this sort of reality-check was rarely if ever aired.

Igor was then able to continue to Moshav Yated and his family. Once he saw they were safe, he gathered a band of community members to defend their village until the army arrived hours later. Thanks to Igor, not a single person in his village was killed. - Amir Tsarfati #fbisrael",with

Palestine Solidarity Committee - Austin, Texas
November 5 at 2:12 AM ·

🚨🚨🚨TEXAS STATE-WIDE PROTEST: 🚨🚨🚨

The State of Texas allocates $2.9 million annually to support Israel, funding war crimes, home demolitions, settlement construction, and the ongoing onslaught of the Gaza Strip. Despite this, Greg Abbott recently visited Israel and expressed Texas's support for Israel, overlooking the continuous suffering of the Palestinian people at the hands of the zionist entity. Nearly ten thousand Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, and our tax dollars are funding this genocide.

We, the people of Texas, will March at the Texas Capitol to show support for the steadfast people of Gaza, urgently demand an immediate ceasefire, an end to Texas and U.S. aid to Israel, and an immediate end to U.S.-sponsored violence in Gaza. United in solidarity, we march against injustice. 🇵🇸

Join us:
🗓️DATE: Sunday, November 12
⏰TIME: 1-5PM
📍LOCATION: Texas State Capitol; 1100 Congress Avenue, Austin TX 78701

1900 BC: Isaac, Abraham's son, rules over Israel.

1850 BC: Jacob, son of Issac, rules over Israel.

1400 BC: Moses leads the people out of Egypt and back to Israel.

1010 BC: King David unites the 12 tribes into one nation.

930 BC: Israel is divided into two kingdoms, the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah.

800s BC: The rise of the prophets, God's messengers.

722 BC: Kingdom of Israel is conquered by Assyrians.

605 BC: Kingdom Judah is conquered by the Babylonians.

586 BC: Solomon's Temple is destroyed by the Babylonians.

539 BC: Persians conquer the Babylonians and take control of Israel.

538 BC: The Jews return to Israel from exile.

520 BC: The Temple is rebuilt.

450 BC: Reforms made by Ezra and Nehemiah.

433 BC: Malachi is the end of the prophetic age.

432 BC: The last group of Jews return from exile.

333 BC: The Greeks conquer the Persian empire.

After that, the people were captives to the Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, and Crusaders. Through all of these events, the Jewish people continued to live in Israel. There were more or less of them, depending on the centuries, but there was never a time when the Jews didn't live in the land.

"The tomb of King Solomon's wife is being desecrated and destroyed with trash and filth!

Israel Photography is in Jerusalem, Israel.
October 30 at 5:57 PM · Jerusalem, Israel ·

""Destroying Biblical History"" | Legend has it that the building pictured bottom center is 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐛 𝐨𝐟 𝐊𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐦𝐨𝐧's Egyptian wife. Dating back to the Kingdom of Judah, this rock-cut tomb is one of the most ornate ever found from the era of the 1st Temple in Jerusalem. The monolith is gigantic, with several rooms that burrow back deep into the bedrock (beyond what you can see in this picture). Sadly, the residents living around the tomb in the Arab-majority village of Silwan have turned this once-magnificent piece of history into a trash bin; we can only hope that there are still some remnants remaining of the 1st-Temple-era carvings within.
ADDENDUM:
This hardly means that all Arabs are bad, and I hope that no one reading this is racist enough to assume so. My point is not to say that, but rather that this conflict has put both the history and future of the Jewish people in jeopardy - our entire existence. I've seen too many people say that Israel's response is too harsh, using clearly-inflated numbers to dehumanize Israel. But we are people just like everyone else, and we recognize that many of the people on the other side of the Gaza border just want to live their lives freely as we do.
We cannot live freely though, fearing for our lives every time we look up into the sky.
We cannot live freely if there are terrorist militants who want to do nothing less than rape, kidnap, and murder us - even our mothers, grandmothers, grandfathers, children.
We cannot live freely knowing that an army stands on our doorstep with the sole self-proclaimed intention of driving us into the sea.
We cannot live freely knowing that there are people who will stop at nothing to bring down our democratic nation, where Arabs and Jews alike are encouraged to vote, take part in parliament, equally join the workforce, and more - every Israeli citizen is treated equally.
We WILL stand and fight for our lives. Will you stand with us?

Should that Islamic hamas nazi be executed? We'll, what about if he had 10 friends helping him, each one cutting a part of that baby? Should they be executed whenever they are caught? And if we capture them and give them food, water and electricity would that be moral in your eyes? Or immoral? So that they can do it again. We'll, what about if 100, or 1000, or a million such like-minded terrorists helped in butchering this mother and the child by supporting, giving aid and comfort (not to mention voting them in power)...would it still be disproportionate to kill these terrorists and their supporters???

Dear President Johnson,

On October 7, Hamas committed atrocities against Jews that were more savage than anything the Nazis committed. They murdered more Jews than on any day since the Holocaust.

Those who support Hamas and blame Israel for the war, as did your RAs on October 18, are supporting Nazis who are more savage than ISIS. Your RAs further claimed that there is “no space” for Zionism at Wellesley.

That means, there is no space for Jews.

It is outrageous that you would have not removed them from their roles after such an antisemitic statement. They never rescinded their remarks but only apologized for how it affected others and clarified that it did not express the views of the college.

Are you stupid? Does a person not have the right to defend himself and his land?? Hamas is a resistance movement to the Zionist occupation. It only defends its people, my friend. In Europe and America, Hamas is promoted as a terrorist!! They falsify the truth to their people because of their religious fanaticism, but they knew the truth and knew who the real criminal was. If you compared the number of dead Israelis and Palestinians, you would be silent. The number of dead in Israel will not exceed 100.

⚠️Trigger Warning ⚠️ RAPE and MURDER ⚠️ I just read a report in Tablet Magazine from a survivor of the Hamas terrorist attack, specifically what had happened in the rave in the south, who witnessed a genocide with a mass rape happening. They said, women have been raped at the area of the rave, next to their friends’ dead bodies. Several of these women, these rape victims, appear to have later been executed. Others were kidnapped into Gaza. In a footage released online by Hamas, you can see several girls paraded through Gaza’s city streets, some of them half naked and others with blood gushing from between their legs.If you are a woman, if you are a man, if you’re a human being and you’re not outraged by this, that is a serious problem. There is no equivocating this. There is no excusing this. There is no, yeah-but-the, any of what had happened in Israel, any of this. Today across the US and several other places around the world, there were rallies in support of Hamas. The world needs to understand that they’re not supporting some resistance movement of freedom fighters of oppressed people. They’re not. Hamas is a genocidal, radical Islamic, misogynistic, terrorist organization that is committing, in addition to genocide, rape terrorism and has one goal and one goal only and that is the extermination of the Jewish people.",neutral

The Golden Gate in Jerusalem is a place of profound historical and spiritual significance, making it an absolute must-visit for anyone exploring this remarkable city. Here's what makes it so fascinating:

The Golden Gate, also known as the Gate of Mercy or Sha'ar Harachamim, holds an incredible history dating back over a millennium. It was first constructed in the 7th century AD and has been the scene of countless historical events.

The Golden Gate plays a pivotal role in several major religions. In Judaism, it is believed to be the site of the Messiah's arrival. In Christianity, it's associated with Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem, and in Islam, it's considered one of the gates through which the Day of Judgment will commence.

""A stunning must-read investigation published today by Local Call and The Intercept reveals that, of the 11 Palestinians killed in the West Bank on May 14th, at least four were killed in what appears to be no less than a coordinated assault carried out jointly by settlers and soldiers. The article shows, among other things, IDF officers standing beside a masked attacker as he shoots with what appears to be a military rifle. In another incident, a Civilian Security Coordinator (settler in charge of 'security') is seen instructing soldiers what to do. We've written many times - particularly since the beginning of the pandemic, a period in which cases have soared - about violence perpetrated by settlers while IDF soldiers have been seen standing idly by, or clearly in a position to stop it but decline to do so. We've talked about how soldiers are often instructed - as is made clear by the testimonies we've published - that their job is to protect settlers from Palestinians, even when the violence is evidently coming from the other direction. We've even described incidents in which settlers attack local Palestinians, and when the soldiers arrive they take an active part in the attacks, using stun grenades etc. against the very Palestinians bearing the brunt of the violence.
But what this article describes is a major escalation. In at least four separate villages, there is much evidence and numerous testimonies of what can only be described as a premeditated, coordinated attack. As shocking as this exposé is, it's important to remember how this kind of thing comes about: a close relationship between settlers and the IDF, whereby settlers are considered a credible authority on 'security' matters, as we described in our testimony booklet, 'The High Command' (see link in bio); and of course 54 years of occupation in the oPt, under which millions of Palestinians lack basic rights, living their lives under different rules than those required of the settlers. There's a direct line between that starting point, and where we are today. It's time to wake up. ""

Davao Youth for Palestine
Yesterday at 1:42 PM ·

For weeks, the world has been witnessing the horrors of atrocities that, day after day, only escalated the conflict between Israel and Palestine. The human rights violations committed, the devastating loss of lives, and the threat of innocent civilians suffering the same fate all call for any person of conscience to speak out against them.

By organizing this gathering for people across different backgrounds, we hope to express our solidarity with Palestine and call for an end to the suffering of innocent civilians.

Join us as we call for unconditional ceasefire, peace, and justice in Palestine through a Solidarity Gathering at Freedom Park, Davao City, on November 12, 2023, at 3:00 PM. In the spirit of unity, let us emphasize the urgent need for a resolution to the ongoing conflict, fostering an atmosphere where dialogue and understanding prevail over discord.

We ask everyone who will be attending the gathering to maintain a peaceful and respectful environment, ensuring that our shared message for a better future remains at the forefront. Let's stand united, fostering a peaceful assembly that amplifies our call for a peaceful resolution in Palestine.

Guidelines and reminders will follow.

ISRAEL – OPPRESSOR or OPPRESSED? Know the facts! TRUTH is the path to peace!

Way too many people see Israel as the oppressor in the current conflict, and because of this, they support those who they perceive as the underdog. But the TRUTH is the exact opposite!

HAPPENING RIGHT NOW! Israel is still David, who, even today, is fighting the Goliaths of Evil.

If Hamas survives, they will do what they always do, come after Israel again with bigger, more powerful and more accurate weapons. As they themselves say. Their goal is for more Oct. 7th attacks and their goal is to destroy Israel, “kill Jews’’ and crush the United States and other democracies.

And the “poor” Palestinians that so many feel sorry for, support Hamas and the violence against Jews, and participated in the barbaric attacks against Israel civilians on Oct 7th. https://www.israelhayom.com/opinions/hamas-does-represent-the-palestinians/

STOP ANTISEMITISM! END THE HATE and VIOLENCE that threatens our Jewish Family, Israel and the world! AM YISRAEL CHAI! (Let Israel live!)

WE SUPPORT ISRAEL AGAINST the FORCES of DARKNESS, those who continue to cast their shroud of death and hate against Jews and Israel! Their maliciousness is damaging the world, and the possibility of a better future for all people!

Blatant anti-Semitic attacks are increasing worldwide, while pro-Israel speakers and supporters, trying to share our truth, are denied the right to express themselves. DARKNESS IS SPREADING EVERYWHERE! Things are spinning out of control… and getting worse!

Today’s Goliaths are the outright Jew/Israel haters, and additionally, include all misguided people whose actions threaten Israel! These are all MAJOR challenges Israel MUST defend itself against if it is to survive: Iran, Hezbollah, Turkey, Syria, BDS, antisemitism, and sadly, many Jewish people, and others, who support two more Arab dictatorships and regimes, Abbas and Hamas, over their own family!

Why would anyone support those who want to destroy our Jewish family? How can any rational, moderately intelligent person, not see what is happening here? Bizarre!

Israel has offered peace continuously, but, as has been shown time and again, Abbas, Hamas and Israel’s other enemies don’t want peace. Their only goal is the destruction of Israel! No alternatives are acceptable to them! Yet, so many people still don’t get it, or refuse to accept, these FACTS!

Yet, what’s almost as dangerous as Israel’s enemies, are those people who sympathize with those whose objective is to eliminate Israel! It is madness! How many of these people would support Voldemort over Harry Potter? How many would have backed the Nazis in their efforts to destroy the Jews? How many Jews, and others, are rooting for Goliath, Israel’s enemies, to defeat David/Israel? Doesn’t make any sense at all!

Israel is the GOOD guy in this scenario, and it doesn’t make sense that anyone who cares about Israel’s survival should be supporting the Goliaths!

WE SUPPORT ISRAEL!

AM YISRAEL CHAI! SHAVUA TOV and L’CHAYIM!

The West must keep its knee off Israel’s neck.
Israel has made errors in the past at the urging of the West. It signed the Oslo Accords in 1993. Why was Shimon Peres anxious to have Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the terrorist leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, shake hands in front of President Bill Clinton? One might speculate that Arafat’s propaganda success was a precursor to 9/11.
Oslo brought the PLO and its weapons into Israel. A neophyte diplomat could have foreseen that Jews and Arabs would die.
Hamas launched several wars against Israel in keeping with its charter, which calls for killing Jews everywhere. Invariably there are calls for a cease-fire. Israel is restrained and waits for the next attack from one or another of Hamas’s partners. Finally, on Oct. 7, it went too far.
Hamas’s barbarism shocked even its most ardent admirers. Thousands were butchered; millions mourn. Like the Taliban and ISIS, Hamas must be crushed. It must never again be allowed to poison the Middle East. Israel is prepared to defang the snake. Israelis and Arabs will pay with their lives. That’s the price of purging the world of evil. The West should support Israel — not call for restraint.

🔴Nuking Gaza is an option: Israeli 'heritage' minister.
Amichai Eliyahu asked during an interview with Radio Kol Brama whether an atomic bomb should be dropped on Gaza.

He also expressed strong opposition to allowing any humanitarian aid into Gaza, describing Gazans as ""Nazis"" and ""monsters"" who should find another land to live on.

The Israeli heritage minister said the northern strip had no right to exist, adding that anyone flying a Palestinian or Hamas flag ""should not be alive on earth.""

In a similar, overtly racist comment last month, Israeli Minister of Military Affairs Yoo Galant said the government in Tel Aviv was ""fighting human animals in Gazaand we are acting accordingly.""

"Still crying over October 7?

Now... Let's look at some of the obvious FACTS:

Zionists murderers literally invaded Palestine in 1947/48 and raped, murdered, looted and displaced around 750 000 plus Palestinians.

The Allies armed and supported these Zionist murderers and covered up their atrocious war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Also, please explain the Deir Yasin Massacre and Tantura Massacre (Google if you don't know what I'm talking about).

Oops... I forgot... crimes against humanity and war crimes only applies to Western European (white) people...

So if you not white or in the West, you're pretty much fair game for all the phosphorus bombs and chemical weapons and all the nasty stuff that the Geneva Convention has BANNED!

Israel has murdered, raped, looted, dispossessed, displaced, cut off food and water supplies and aid to Palestinians for 75+ years!

Also...

Israel created, trained, armed and funded Hamas, since 1987, to counter Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Liberation Organization and to cause disruption in Gaza and Palestine.

But many joined Hamas with a sincere and honest intent and most of Hamas consists of the genuine freedom fighters...

Another thing: no way in hell did Hamas bypass the most secure and survailled area in the world, unless they were allowed to by israel.

And let's use our common sense regarding the October 7th attack...

Why was a rave organized near the Gazan Border, during high tensions with no security, in Israel, where security and military are part and parcel of daily life???

Why did nobody at the rave take actual phone footage of ""Hamas"" attacking them???

Surely all those ravers had phones??

The IDF who has surveillance on Gaza and Westbank with cameras, drones, armed guards and soldiers 24-7-365 ...

But they all took 6 hours to respond while Gazans used a noisy tractor to breach the usually electrified fence...

And the paragliders would've been shot down way before they made it to the wall around Gaza..

But all the soldiers and guards and drones somehow missed all this activity...

The 40 babies who were beheaded... why were their parents never interviewed and pics shown of the 40 bodies?

Why? How? Why?

Hamas was the elected government since 2006, by the Palestinians...

But the West would argue they rigged the election at gunpoint.

Hamas is supplying vital aid, water and food to all the desperate, beseiged people in Gaza...

Hamas is defending and rightfully resisting against the baby killer Israeli invaders...

And...

Even if Hamas was 100% responsible for the October 7th attack (which they clearly could not have carried out without Israel's knowledge and blessing)...

So what?

That attack was an effect of a root cause...

It is absolutely incredible how many people are brainwashed and don’t even stop for a second to research even the smallest bit of history of the Jewish people and their ancestral homeland, the place that they are indigenous to -> Israel.

It was only in the 2nd century CE, that the Romans crushed the revolt of Shimon Bar Kokhba (132 CE), during which Jerusalem and Judea were conquered, and the area of Judea was renamed Palaestina in an attempt to minimize Jewish identification with the land of Israel.

Even the Dome of the Rock located at our Kotel (the western wall) sits on top of our Holy Temple(s), not the other way around.

Like you, I don’t like to see this woman’s face - a woman who has fully given herself over to the powers of the evil inclination, the other side of Godliness, the other side of light, the other side of truth - but she has double the number of followers on Instagram than the number of Jews in the world and it’s important to educate people and this video by Loay Lalshareef directed at her perpetual lies does exactly that.

They sent me home with more grape leaves, lamb for Greg, a kaffiyeh, and their last bag of cardamom coffee from Palestine. They talked about how nice Greg is for shoveling their snow. She said she would make kenafe ( my favorite Palestinian desert)for me.

Stop making change theoretical and abstract. It is knocking on neighbor’s doors and sharing coffee and sweets. It is telling each other stories. It is heart to heart, neighbor to neighbor. We are all human. We all want a place to call home and for our babies and grandmothers to be safe. Peace begins with me. “

Was going to focus on informing the public of 7amas history, the dangerous legislations being proposed around the world against Palestinians, and the many hard truths of the rogue extremist 7errorist Israeli government & Mossad.

However my ❤️ is too heavy. It's too angry.
I'm the only Palestinian on a remote island in Africa. I was supposed to be in Egypt by now, skating, working to go or bring talented child athletes from Palestine across Rafah to train💔 but that's on hold because Israel may bomb Egypt at any moment and none of my children are reachable 💔

I don't even know how I found the composure to hold this interview, so I decided to lead and focus with humanity. This is a cry for humanity. We'll share all the cold hard facts we intended to cover in short more digestible clips and stories. Make sure to follow us.

Psalm 31:18 Psalm 33:1-11 Psalm 40:14-15 Psalm 119:85 Prov. 15:8, 29 Isaiah 37:16 Jeremiah 17:9 Jeremiah 32:17 John 15:16 Ephesians 1:4
Oh, Lord God! Behold, You Yourself have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You, For nothing will be impossible with God. Lord of armies, God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim, You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made heaven and earth. The Holy One, Alpha and Omega, Beginning and the End.
Lord, You are far from the wicked, You hear the prayers of the righteous. Listen to our prayers, God;And do not hide Yourself from our intercession pleading. Give Your attention to us and answer us; we are restless in our complaint and severely distracted, because of the voice of the enemy, because of the pressure of the wicked. For they bring down trouble upon Israel and in anger they hold a grudge against Israel. Our hearts are in anguish within us, the hateful things the world say about Israel. The horrible things people plot against the Jews and against Israel. But we trust in You Lord with all our hearts and we do not lean on our own understanding. We trust in Your Word that speaks against the wicked. Let the lying lips be speechless, which speak arrogantly against the righteous with pride and contempt.
The hearts of Israel’s enemies are more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick. Who can understand it? For out of the heart comes evil thoughts, murders, acts of adultery, other immoral sexual acts, thefts, false testimonies, and slanderous statements. The arrogant have dug pits for Israel, People who are not in accord with Your Law. May those be ashamed and humiliated together who seek the life of the Jews to destroy it; May those be turned back and dishonoured, who delight in Israel’s hurt. May those be appalled because of their shame. You said Lord that You will deal with them according to their anger and according to their envy which they displayed because of their hatred for Israel; make Yourself known among them when You judge them. Let the enemy know that You Lord God, have heard all their insults which they have spoken against the mountains of Israel saying, ‘They are desolate; they have been given to us as food.’ And they have spoken arrogantly against You Lord, and have multiplied their words against You. Release Your favour and glory on Your beloved Israel and protect her with Your Holy Fire! Every evil word spoken over her shall become a word of praise. The Lord nullifies the plan of nations; He frustrates the plans of peoples. The plan of the Lord stands forever, the plans of His heart from generation to generation!!",against

Arabs in Israel have full rights just like any other citizen - they can study, work, get high-ranking jobs, vote, and get elected for government. That can't be said about the citizens of Syria, Iran, Iraq. Israel is a democracy, while most surrounding Arab countries are dictatorships committing mass murders of their own citizens, giving women no rights, and having laws of executing LGBTQ people. Stand with the only democracy in the Middle East. Stand with Israel. #Israel #TheTruthAboutIsrael #StandWithIsrael

According to the latest report from Al-Alam, Israel's military efforts through two new fronts in Khan Younis as well as attacks from the sea using warships against the Al-Nuseirat area in the coastal route, were successfully thwarted by the Palestinian Fighter movement.
A correspondent from the Al-Alam news network in Gaza reported that, following Israeli maneuvers to penetrate the Al-Nuseirat area in Gaza from two new Khan Younis axes and naval attacks, the Palestinian resistance succeeded in trapping the occupying forces in an ambush. In this incident, the resistance succeeded in destroying two Israeli military vehicles using Yasin 105 rockets and RPGs. This incident was in the spotlight on Hezbollah's official channel,",neutral

"ACTION ALERT:

Insist MIT suspend students who barred Jews from class!
Sample letter & emails below.

president@mit.edu; nelsonsm@mit.edu

Dear President Kornbluth and Dean Nelson,

On November 9, you allowed an antisemitic mob (members of Coalition Against Apartheid-CAA) to bar Jewish and Israeli students from attending classes. This mob called for violence against Jews (Intifada). You told Jewish students that they should not enter from the front of the building for their own security, but did nothing to protect them yourselves.

Instead of suspending students who participated in this behavior that clearly violates MIT codes and likely state and/or federal laws, as you had said you would, you merely suspended them from extra-curricular activity.

In doing so, you have made MIT unsafe for Jews-\-\and this in the twenty-first century.

I insist that you suspend these students immediately. Please notify me promptly of your action.

Thank you.",against
